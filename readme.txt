Cleans up your WordPress installation by removing and regenerating thumbnails.

== Description ==
**Thumbnails Cleaner** helps you keeping your WordPress installation tidy by removing and regenerating thumbnails.

All functions can be controlled from the plugins' main page found under "Tools". You can:

* **Create backups** of your uploads directory so that you won't lose any files.
* **Analyze** your uploads directory, giving you an overview how many original files and thumbnails there are.
* **Clean thumbnails** which will delete all of them while keeping the original files.
* **Restore thumbnails** to start out with a clean uploads directory. This function requires the plugin [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
* **Restore backups** in case you have lost a file that was not supposed to be deleted.

**Please see the [official website](http://www.koljanolte.com/wordpress/plugins/thumbnail-cleaner/) for a full
documentation.**

If you have any other ideas for features, please don't hesitate to submit them by [sending me an e-mail](mailto:kolja.nolte@gmail.com) and I'll try my best to implement it in the next version. Your WP.org username will be added to the plugin's contributor list, of course (if you provide one).
